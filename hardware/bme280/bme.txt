reads barometric pressure, temperature and humidity
12c interface
3 operation modes
-> sleep mode - no operation,all registers accessible,lowest power
-> normal mode - perpetual cycling of measurement and inactive modes
-> forced mode - perform one measurement store result and return to sleep mode



global memory map and register description

Registers
~~~~~~~~~~
\\\\\\\\\
~~~~~~~~~~
8 bit registers
---------------
data registers
Register          reset state
hum_lsb - 0xFE -  0x00
hum_msb - 0XFD -  0x00

status registers
----------------
register 0xF3 -> contains 2 bits which indicate the status of the device
bit 3 - measuring -> automatically set to 1 whenever a conversion is running and back to 0 when the 
results have been transferred to the data registers

bit 0 - im_update -> automatically set to 1 when the NVM data are being copied to image registers
and back to 0 when the copying is done. The data are copied at power-on-reset and before every conversion


control registers
-----------------
config  - 0xF5 
Sets the rate,filter and interface options of the device
Writes to the config register in normal mode may be ignored in sleep mode however they are not ignored

bit 7,6,5 - t_sb[2:0] -> controls inactive duration tstandby in normal mode
bit 4,3,2 - filter[2:0] -> controls the time constant of the IIR filter 
bit 0 - s 

ctrl_meas - 0xF4 -> sets pressure and temperature data acquisition options of the device
The register needs to be written after changing "ctrl_hum" for the changes to become effective

bit 7,6,5 -  osrs_t[2:0] - controls oversampling of temperature data  
bit 4,3,2 - osrs_p[2:0] - controls oversampling of pressure data 
bit 1,0 - mode[1:0] - controls the sensor mode of the device

*** oversampling bits same as for ctrl_hum

mode[1:0]		mode
00				sleep mode
01 and 10		forced mode
11				normal mode


ctrl_hum - 0xF2 -> sets the humidity data acquisition options of the device 
changes to this register only become efficient after a write operation to ctrl_meas
bit 2,1,0    osr_h[2:0] controls oversampling of humidity data. 
	value                    Humidity oversampling
	000								skipped no humidity
	001								oversamplingx1
	010								oversamplingx2
	011								oversamplingx4
	100								oversamplingx8
	101,others						oversamplingx16


other reserved registers
------------------------
id -> 0xD0  - contains the chip identification number


Reset register
--------------
0xE0 contains a soft word reset if the value of 0xB6 is written in the register, the device is reset
